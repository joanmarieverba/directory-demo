# Directory-demo
The purpose of this respository is to store code for a directory app.  
Many organizations need to create directories of members and keep them up.  
This app allows members of an organization to add or change their data (name, address, phone, email, other details),  
and then view or print the entire directory. 
Each member creates a unique id to use. The app then keeps track of that ID. The Admin can see all IDs.

Written in ReactJS using Aphrodite, Horizon, Elemental UI among others.

Features:
Responsive design  
Login with ID  
Alphabetical directory  
Search function  
Print/save function  
Confirmation page   
Ability for Admin to delete records
